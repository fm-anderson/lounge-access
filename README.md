# Lounge Access

This simple Elixir application is intended to help me understand the basic syntax and functional constructs in Elixir. It is structured using the Application behaviour from the Elixir standard library. It's a concise example that encapsulates basic features of the Elixir language while being practical enough to illustrate typical use cases involving conditionals and standard output operations.
