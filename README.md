# Lounge Access

This simple Elixir application is intended to help me understand the basic syntax and functional constructs in Elixir, including process supervision, random selection, and using external libraries. It utilizes the Application behavior from Elixir's standard library for process management and introduces the use of the UUID library, which is essential for generating unique user identifiers.

It's a concise example that encapsulates basic features of the Elixir language while being practical enough to illustrate typical use cases involving conditionals and standard output operations.
